"""
    Computes the Optimal SubPattern Assignment (OSPA) distance [1] for two sets
    of 'Track' objects. The OSPA distance is measured between two
    point patterns. Main skeleton is taken from 'StoneSoup' documentation [2].

    The OSPA metric is calculated at each time step in which a 'Track'
    object is present

        Computes the Optimal SubPattern Assignment (OSPA) metric for a single
        time step between two point patterns. Each point pattern consisting of
        a list of states.

        The function :math:`\bar{d}_{p}^{(c)}` is the OSPA metric of order
        :math:`p` with cut-off :math:`c`. The OSPA metric is defined as:
